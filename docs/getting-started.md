# Getting Started with Anovos ðŸš€

_Anovos_ provides data scientists and ML engineers with powerful and versatile tools for feature engineering.

To get you started quickly, we have prepared an interactive _Getting Started Guide_.
All you need is [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (see [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
for instructions how to install it on your machine).

The easiest way to try out _Anovos_ and explore its capabilities is through the provided
[examples](/examples) that you can run via Docker without the need to install anything
on your local machine.

```bash
# Launch an anovos-examples Docker container
sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 anovos/anovos-examples-3.2.0:latest
```

To reach the Jupyter environment, open the link to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token...`
generated by the Jupyter NotebookApp.

If you're not familiar with _Anovos_ or feature engineering, the _Getting Started with
Anovos_ guide is a good place to begin your journey.
You can find it in the `/guides` folder within the Jupyter environment.

For more detailed instructions on how to install Docker and how to troubleshoot potential
issues, see the [examples README](https://github.com/anovos/anovos/blob/main/examples/README.md).
