# Getting Started with Anovos üöÄ

_Anovos_ provides data scientists and ML engineers with powerful and versatile tools for feature engineering.

To get you started quickly, we have prepared an interactive _Getting Started Guide_.
All you need is [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (see [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
for instructions how to install it on your machine).

Once you've finished the guide, the best way to explore what _Anovos_ has to offer is through the provided
[examples](https://github.com/anovos/anovos/tree/main/examples) that are included in the `anovos-examples`
Docker image as well.

To launch an `anovos-examples` Docker container that contains both the guide and the examples,
execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 anovos/anovos-examples-3.2.2:latest
```

‚ö†Ô∏è _Please be aware that this will download several GB of data from Docker Hub._

üí° _Depending on your Docker setup, you might encounter an error message `Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at ...`._
   _Quite often, this means that your user account lacks permission to access it, and you need to prefix the_
   _call to Docker with `sudo`, i.e., execute `sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 anovos/anovos-examples-3.2.2:latest`._

The numbers in the image's name specify the Spark version.
To see all available image versions, head over to [our Docker Hub profile](https://hub.docker.com/u/anovos).

To reach the Jupyter environment, open the link to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token...`
generated by the Jupyter NotebookApp.

If you're not familiar with _Anovos_ or feature engineering, the _Getting Started with
Anovos_ guide is a good place to begin your journey.
You can find it in the `/guides` folder within the Jupyter environment.

For more detailed instructions on how to install Docker and how to troubleshoot potential
issues, see the [examples README](https://github.com/anovos/anovos/blob/main/examples/README.md).
