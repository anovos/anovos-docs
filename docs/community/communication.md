# Anovos Communication Channels

There are different ways and channels that you can use as a community member or maintainer to raise questions, collaborate or to have some fun!

## Slack
The community has a channel on the [ML-Ops Community Slack](https://go.mlops.community/slack) called #oss-anovos. Feel free to join us. This channel is the perfect place to have your first point of contact with the community. The maintainers and some contributors hang out on it.

## GitHub Issues
The Anovos repository has issues enabled. If you need some help or have questions or ideas you can open an issue in this repository. If you have any questions about raising an issue, feel free to drop a message on Slack.

## Contributors Mailing List
If you want to follow discussions about the Anovos development or you want to become a contributor there is a mailing list about that. This is not right place for general questions related to how Anovos works. The focus is 100% on ongoing or future development.

Google Group: anovos-contributors
anovos-contributors@googlegroups.com

We have a monthly meeting to sync ongoing work or discuss future development efforts around the various components. You will be added to it automatically when joining the mailing list. There is an agenda available via Google Docs; feel free to add your item in there before the meeting.
