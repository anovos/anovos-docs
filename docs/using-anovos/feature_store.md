# Feature Store Integration

Feature stores are an essential building block of a modern MLOps setup.
For an introduction into the concept and an overview of available options and vendors, see the
[Feature Store Comparison & Evaluation](https://mlops.community/learn/feature-store/)
on the [MLOps Community website](https://mlops.community/).

_Anovos_ provides integration with [Feast](https://www.feast.dev), a widely used open source feature store,
out of the box.
Using the same abstractions, it is straightforward to integrate _Anovos_ with other feature stores.

If there is a particular feature store integration you'd like to see supported by _Anovos_,
[let us know!](../community/communication.md)

## Using _Anovos_ with Feast

The following guide describes how to use _Anovos_ to push data to Feast.
We assume that you are familiar with the fundamentals of both _Anovos_ workflows and Feast.

For an introduction to Feast, see [📖 the Feast Quickstart guide](https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/quickstart).

### Prerequisites

In order to use _Anovos_ with Feast, you need to install it:

```bash
pip install feast
```

Next, we'll instantiate a new Feast repository:

```bash
feast init anovos_repo
```

🤓  _Note: You can also use an existing repository._
In this case, Anovos will simply add a new file anovos.py containing the feature definitions as well as the
output file to the existing repository.

### Adding the Feast export to your _Anovos_ workflow

To export data to Feat at the end of a workflow run, you need to add the `write_feast_features` block
to the configuration file. (To learn more about the configuration file in general and available options,
see [📖 the configuration file documentation](config_file.md).)

You can use the following template as a starting point:

```yaml
write_feast_features:
  file_path: "../anovos_repo/"                     # the location of your Feast repository
  entity:
    name: "income"                                 # the Feast entity
    description: "this entity is a ...."           # the entity description used by Feast
    id_col: 'ifa'                                  # the primary key column to identify this entity by
  file_source:
    description: 'data source description'         # the data source description used by Feast
    owner: "me@business.com"                       # the data source owner registered in Feast
    timestamp_col: 'event_time'                    # the name of the logical timestamp at which the feature was observed
    create_timestamp_col: 'create_time_col'        # the name of the physical timestamp (wallclock time)
                                                   # of when the feature value was computed
  feature_view:
    name: 'income_view'                            # the name of the generated feature view
    owner: 'view@owner.com'                        # the view owner registered in Feast
    ttl_in_seconds: 36000000                       # the time to live in seconds for features in this view.
                                                   # Feast will use this value to look backwards when performing
                                                   # point-in-time joins
  service_name: 'income_feature_service'           # the name of the feature service generated by the workflow
  file_configs:
    mode: overwrite                                # optional file config. For an example, see
                                                   # https://docs.anovos.ai/using-anovos/config_file.html#write_main
```

Let's break this down!

The following block generates an
[entity definition in Feast](https://docs.feast.dev/v/master/getting-started/concepts/entity).
This block and all its child elements are mandatory.
the `name` elements specifies the entity name. The `description` element provides a human-readable
description to be displayed
in the Feast UI. The element `id_col` specifies the primary key of the entity.

```yaml
entity:
    name: "income"
    description: "this entity is a ...."
    id_col: 'ifa'
```

The subsequent block generates a
[file source definition in Feast](https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/concepts/data-source).
This block and all its children are mandatory.

The `owner` element describes the owner of the file data source in the shape of an email address.
The two elements `timestamp_col` and `create_timestamp_col` refer to timestamped columns
[used when retrieving data](https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/concepts/point-in-time-joins).

```yaml
file_source:
    description: 'data source description'
    owner: "me@business.com"
    timestamp_col: 'event_time'
    create_timestamp_col: 'create_time_col'
```

The next block generates a
[feature view definition in Feast](https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/concepts/feature-view).
This block and all its children are mandatory.

```yaml
feature_view:
    name: 'income_view'
    owner: 'view@owner.com'
    ttl_in_seconds: 3600
```

The following element generates a
[feature service definition in Feast](https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/concepts/feature-retrieval).
This element is optional.

```yaml
service_name: 'income_feature_service'
```

The block `file_configs` is optional as well.
It contains the Rest of the valid configuration can be passed through this option, e.g.,
  repartition,  mode,  compression,  header,  delimiter,  inferSchema etc. This might look like:

```yaml
file_configs:
  mode: overwrite
```

### Exporting data to Feast

First, run your _Anovos_ workflow with the configuration above.

Once the workflow has finished, switch into the folder of `anovos_feature` repository,
apply the changed feature definitions, and materialize the features:

```bash
cd anovos_repo
feast apply
feast materialize `date "+%Y-%m-%dT"` `date "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"`
```

To verify that the features have been loaded correctly, you can check them using Feast's UI.
Run

```bash
feast ui
```

and access the Feast UI at [`http://127.0.0.1:8888`](http://127.0.0.1:8888).
The UI gives a realtime overview about data sources, entities, feature views etc. of the entire feature repository
(i.e., across multiple .py files that contain feature definitions).

### Retrieve feature data from Feast

The following script shows how to access historical data, e.g., for the purpose of training an ML model.
For more information, see the
[feast documentation on feature retrieval](https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/concepts/feature-retrieval).
Documentation on how to specify `event_time` and its use in point in time joins can be found
[here](https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/concepts/point-in-time-joins).

```python
import datetime
import feast
import pandas as pd

repo_path="./anovos_repo"

store = feast.FeatureStore(repo_path=repo_path)

# ACCESS HISTORICAL FEATURES

# Either read directly from parquet file generated by the Anovos workflow or generated manually
income_entities = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(
    {
        "ifa": [
            "27a",
            "30a",
            "475a",
            "965a",
            "1678a",
            "1698a",
            "1807a",
            "1951a",
            "2041a",
            "2215a",
        ],
        "event_time": [
            datetime.now(),
            datetime.now(),
            datetime.now(),
            datetime.now(),
            datetime.now(),
            datetime.now(),
            datetime.now(),
            datetime.now(),
            datetime.now(),
            datetime.now(),
        ],
    }
)

fs = feast.FeatureStore(repo_path=repo_path)

# Alternative 1: retrieve features via explicit specification
income_features_df = fs.get_historical_features(
    entity_df=income_entities,
    features=[
        "income_view:income",
        "income_view:latent_0",
        "income_view:latent_1",
        "income_view:latent_2",
        "income_view:latent_3",
    ],
).to_df()
print(income_features_df.head())

# Alternative 2: retrieve features using the feature service
feature_service = fs.get_feature_service("income_feature_service")
income_features_by_service_df = fs.get_historical_features(
    features=feature_service, entity_df=income_entities
).to_df()
print(income_features_by_service_df.head())

# Now, you can use the features to train your model

...
```
