# MLflow Integration

[_MLflow_](https://www.mlflow.org/) is a popular open source solution for managing all aspects of the
machine learning lifecycle.
The platform encompasses four components:

- _MLflow Tracking_ to record code, data, configuration, and results of ML experiments
- _MLflow Projects_ to package data science code in a format that allows it to run reproducibly in different environments
- _MLflow Models_ to deploy ML models in different environments
- _MLflow Model Registry_ to store and manage ML models in a central repository

To learn more about _MLflow_ and its capabilities, see the
[_MLflow_ documentation](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html).

## Reporting _Anovos_ data to _MLflow Tracking_

_Anovos_ integrates with _MLflow_ by reporting workflow metadata and results to _MLflow Tracking_.

To add _MLflow_ tracking to your workflow, you can add an `mlflow` block to your
[workflow configuration file](config_file.md):

```yaml
mlflow:
  experiment: "Anovos"                   # The name of the MLflow experiment associated with your workflow
  tracking_uri: "http://127.0.0.1:8889"  # The URL of the MLflow Tracking server
  track_output: True                     # Store the workflow output (i.e., resulting dataset(s))
  track_reports: True                    # Store the generated reports
  track_intermediates: False             # Store any intermediate data generated by your workflow
```

### Current Limitations

## Roadmap

We're exploring integration of _Anovos_ with _MLflow Projects_ and _MLFlow Pipelines_.
[Let us know](../../community/communication.md) which capabilities you'd like to see in future versions of _Anovos_!
