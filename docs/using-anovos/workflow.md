# The Anovos Workflow

We designed Anovos to support the following end-to-end machine learning workflow. A team or organization can do this in one of two ways, either as a complete execution by Anovos or use as part of an existing pipeline. For example, an organization might have an end-to-end workflow that lacks components offered by Anovos. The organization can incorporate additional components by a simple API call for a function from Anovos. The following workflow diagram shows the potential ways to use Anovos in an end-to-end workflow settings.
