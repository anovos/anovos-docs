Anovos is built out and been released as an open source based on the experience we gained in using massive data sets to produce predictive features. At Mobilewalla1, we process tera bytes of Mobile engagement signals daily to mine the consumer behaviour. Those features were then used in building distributed machine learning models to solve the respective business problems. In this journey, we faced lots of challenges by not having a comprehensive and scalable libraries. After realizing the unavailability of such libraries we design and implemented an open source library (ANOVOS) for every Data Scientists’ use.

## The Roadmap
As can be seen above, Anovos will be fully functional in 3 major releases namely alpha, beta and V1.0 respectively. In the alpha release of Anovos will have the basic Data ingestion and  comprehensive data analysis functionalities, in addition to the data pre-processing & cleaning mechanisms. Alpha release of Anovos also will have some key differentiating functionalities such as data drift and stability computations which in turn are very crucial in deciding the need for model refresh/tweaking options. Another key feature of Anovos is that cool visualization component which is very dynamic and can be configured as per every data ingestion pipelines. Every data metric computed out of Anovos ingestion process can be visualized and can be used for CXO level decision making. 

## Beta Release
In the Beta release of Anovos, it will support ingesting from other cloud service providers like MS Azure as well will have mechanisms to read/write different file formats such as avro & nested Json. Further it will also support to ingest various data types (see figure for the details). Key differentiating functionality of beta release would be the “Feature wiki” for Data Scientists/end users to resolve their cold-start problems, which will immensely reduce their literature search time. In addition, beta release will also have another key functionality to explain the each attributes’ contribution in feature building which we call as “Attribute-> Feature” mapper 

## Full Release
The complete functional Anovos will be released in March 2022 with the functionalities to support the end to end machine learning workflow. It will have the feasibility to store the generated features in an open source feature stores like Feast. Also it will support running open source based Auto ML models and ML workflow integration. Another critical feature which would be available in the March 2022 release is, to have a mechanism to explain the model behaviour by having the respective shapely values.
