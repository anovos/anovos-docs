Anovos modules are created in order to reflect the key components of Machine Learning (ML) pipeline. They are also built in a scalable manner using python API of Spark (PySpark) - the distributed computing framework. 

The key modules included in the alpha release are: 

1. **Data Ingest**:   
    This module is ETL (Extract, transform, load) component of Anovos and helps in loading dataset(s) as Spark Dataframe. It also allows performing some basic preprocessing, such as selecting, deleting, renaming and recasting columns, to ensure that cleaner data is used in downstream data analysis. 
2. **Data Analyzer**:  
    This data analysis module gives 360o view on the ingested data and helps with better understanding of the data quality and the transformations that may be required for the modelling purpose. This module is further divided into 3 submodules targeting specific needs of the data analysis process. 
       
    a. *Statistics Generator*: This submodule generates all descriptive statistics related to the ingested data. Descriptive statistics is further broken down into different metric types such as Measures of Counts, Measures of Central Tendency, Measures of Cardinality, Measures of Dispersion (aka Measures of Spread in Statistics), Measures of Percentiles (aka Measures of Position), and Measures of Shape (aka Measures of Moments). 
        
    b. *Quality Checker*: This submodule focusses on assessing the data quality at both row and column level. Also, there is an option to fix the identified issues with the right treatment method. The row level quality checks include duplicate detection and null detection (% columns which are missing for a row). On the other hand, the column level quality checks include outlier detection, null detection (% rows which are missing for a column), biasedness detection (checking if a column is biased towards one specific value), cardinality detection (checking if a categorical/discrete column have very high no. of unique values) and invalid entries detection which checks for suspicious patterns in the column values.  
        
    c. *Association Evaluator*: This submodule focuses on understanding the interaction between different attributes (correlation, variable clustering) and/or the relationship between an attribute & the binary target variable (Information Gain, Information Value). 

3. **Data Drift**:
    In ML context, Data Drift is the change in distribution of the baseline dataset on which the model is trained (source distribution) and the ingested data (target distribution) on which prediction is to be made. Data Drift is one of the top reasons behind the poor performance of ML models over time. This module ensures the stability of the ingested dataset over time by analysing it with the baseline dataset (via computing drift statistics) and/or with historically ingested datasets (via computing stability index â€“ currently supports only numerical features), if available. Identifying the data drift at early stage enables data scientists to be proactive and fix the root cause. 
4. **Data Transformer**:
    In the alpha release, data transformer module only includes some basic pre-processing functions such binning, encoding, to name a few. These functions were required to support computations of the above key modules. However, in the future releases, more exhaustive set of transformations can be expected. 
5. **Data Report**:
    This module is visualization component of Anovos. All the analysis done on the key modules are visualized via a html report for the user to get well-rounded understanding of the ingested dataset. The report contains executive summary, wiki for data dictionary & metric dictionary, a tab corresponding to key modules demonstrating the output. 

Note: Upcoming Modules - Feature Wiki, Feature store, Auto ML, ML Flow Integration
